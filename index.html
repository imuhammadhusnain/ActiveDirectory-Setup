    <h1>Introduction to Active Directory</h1>
    <p>Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft. It is used to manage permissions and access to networked resources, such as user accounts, computers, and other devices within a domain. AD plays a central role in network administration by enabling administrators to easily manage resources, enforce security policies, and provide centralized authentication and authorization.</p>

        <h2>2. Installing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</h2>
        <p>AD DS is the role that provides user authentication and resource management in your network.</p>
        <h3>Steps to Install AD DS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open Server Manager:</strong> Log in and click the <strong>Server Manager</strong> icon.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Roles and Features:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on <strong>Add Roles and Features</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Continue clicking <strong>Next</strong> until you reach the <strong>Server Roles</strong> section.</li>
                    <li>Check <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Install:</strong> Review the features and click <strong>Install</strong>. The AD DS components will now be installed.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imuhammadhusnain/ActiveDirectory-Setup/main/AD%20DS%20error%20prerequisite.png" alt="Promoting the server to a domain controller" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin-top: 20px;">

    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Note:</strong> I resolved the error by going to <strong>Tools</strong> at the top right in Server Manager, removing the AD CS service, completing the promotion of the server to a Domain Controller, and then reinstalling the AD CS from Tools after the promotion was completed successfully.
    </div>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>3. Promoting the Server to a Domain Controller</h2>
        <p>Once AD DS is installed, you need to promote the server to a Domain Controller (DC).</p>
        <h3>Steps to Promote the Server:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open Server Manager:</strong> Again, go to the <strong>Notification Flag</strong> at the top right and select <strong>Promote this server to a domain controller</strong>.</li>

                    <li>Set the <strong>Forest functional level</strong> (Windows Server 2016 or higher is recommended).</li>
                    <li>Set the <strong>Domain functional level</strong> (same as the forest level).</li>
                    <li>Set the <strong>DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode)</strong> password.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Complete the Promotion:</strong> After reviewing your settings, click <strong>Next</strong>. The server will be promoted to a domain controller and will reboot automatically once finished.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. Installing and Configuring DNS</h2>
        <p>DNS is crucial for the AD DS to function correctly because it helps resolve domain names to IP addresses.</p>
        <h3>Steps to Install and Configure DNS:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Install the DNS Role:</strong> You can install the DNS role during the promotion process. If you missed it:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open <strong>Server Manager</strong> → <strong>Add Roles and Features</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Select the <strong>DNS Server</strong> and proceed with installation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>DNS Configuration:</strong> DNS should be set up automatically during the domain controller promotion. You can manage and verify DNS settings through <strong>DNS Manager</strong>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. Key Concepts You Should Know</h2>
        <h3>Active Directory (AD)</h3>
        <p>Active Directory is like a giant phonebook for your network, storing information about users, computers, and other resources. It allows administrators to manage these resources centrally.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imuhammadhusnain/ActiveDirectory-Setup/main/AD%20Environment.png" alt="Domain Controller" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin-top: 20px;">
        <h3>Domain Controller (DC)</h3>
        <p>A Domain Controller is a server that handles login requests, checks permissions, and manages security within the network. It's the backbone of your AD setup.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imuhammadhusnain/ActiveDirectory-Setup/main/AD%20DS.png" alt="DNS" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin-top: 20px;">
        <h3>DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>
        <p>DNS translates domain names (like <em>example.local</em>) into IP addresses, helping computers on the network find each other.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imuhammadhusnain/ActiveDirectory-Setup/main/DNS%20role.png" alt="DNS" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin-top: 20px;">
        <h2>5. Terminologies in Active Directory</h2>
        <h3>2. Domain</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A domain is like a neighborhood. All the houses (computers, users, devices) in this neighborhood share the same rules and directory. For instance, the domain "example.com" might include all the computers and users in your company.</p>
        <h3>4. Forest</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A forest is a collection of multiple neighborhoods (domains) that share common rules. A company with multiple branches might have a forest that includes domains for each branch.</p>
        <h3>5. Tree</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A tree is a group of domains connected in a hierarchy. "example.com" might have subdomains like "sales.example.com" and "hr.example.com."</p>
        <h3>6. Organizational Unit (OU)</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An OU is like a filing cabinet within a domain. It helps organize users, groups, and computers. You might have an OU for the Sales department and another for HR.</p>
        <h3>7. Global Catalog (GC)</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The GC is a master index that helps you quickly find information across all domains in a forest. If you need to find a user who works in a different branch, the GC can help locate their details.</p>
        <h3>8. Schema</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The schema is the blueprint for your directory. It defines what types of information can be stored. It specifies that a user object can have attributes like name, email, and phone number.</p>
        <h3>9. Group Policy</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Group Policy is a set of rules that apply to everyone in the domain. You can use Group Policy to enforce password complexity requirements for all users.</p>
        <h3>10. Replication</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Replication is the process of copying data between domain controllers to keep everything up-to-date. If you change your password, replication ensures that all DCs know about the change.</p>
        <h3>11. Security Identifier (SID)</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A SID is a unique identifier for each user or group. Even if you change your username, your SID remains the same, ensuring your permissions stay intact.</p>
        <h3>12. Distinguished Name (DN)</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The DN is a full address for an object in the directory. A user's DN might be "CN=John Doe, OU=Sales, DC=example, DC=com."</p>
        <h3>13. Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) Roles</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> These are special tasks assigned to certain domain controllers. The PDC Emulator role helps synchronize time across the domain.</p>

        <h2>6. Configuring Group Policy (GP) & Group Policy Objects (GPO)</h2>
        <p>Group Policy allows administrators to manage and configure security and other settings across their network.</p>
        <h3>Steps to Configure Group Policy:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open Group Policy Management:</strong> From Server Manager, go to <strong>Tools</strong> → <strong>Group Policy Management</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a New GPO:</strong> Right-click on <strong>Group Policy Objects</strong> → <strong>New</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Link the GPO:</strong> Right-click on the domain, site, or OU and select <strong>Link an Existing GPO</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Edit the GPO:</strong> Right-click the GPO and choose <strong>Edit</strong> to configure specific policies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To apply the GPO changes immediately, use the command:</p>
        <pre>gpupdate /force</pre>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>7. Top-Level Policies in Corporate Environments</h2>
        <h3>Password Policy:</h3>
        <p>A strong password policy ensures security by enforcing requirements like minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and expiration.</p>
        <h3>Account Lockout Policy:</h3>
        <p>This policy defines how many failed login attempts a user can have before their account is locked for a specified period. This helps prevent brute-force attacks.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imuhammadhusnain/ActiveDirectory-Setup/main/GPO.png" alt="DNS" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin-top: 20px;">
        <h3>Software Restriction Policies:</h3>
        <p>These policies are used to control which software can or cannot run on domain-connected machines. They enhance security by preventing the execution of unauthorized software.</p>
